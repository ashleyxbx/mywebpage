        <h3>Welcome to 747 Apparel</h3>
      <p>My name is Ashley;Im 16 years old and I started 747 Apparel.</p>
      <p>I came up with this idea While I was in the hosiptal dealing a Bone Marrow Transplant. The reason why I had a Bone Marrow Transplant was because I was trying to cure my Sickle Cell Disease.</p>
      <p>As long as I can remember I always had Sickle Cell Disease.For those who dont know Sickle Cell Disease is blood disorder that can effect your daily life.It causes you to have cronic pain all over your body. </p>
      <p>I had Sickle Cell since I was born and it been affecting my life ever since.For the longest time ive consider thr hospital I go to my second home becuase im always there.</p>
      <p>When I was in 8th grade my parents told me that I would be going through the process of  a Bone Marrow Transplant.In the fall of 2016 I started my treatment at New York Presbtaryn.</p>
      <p>It was truly the hardest thing ive been through.While I was in there I had an idea to make T-shirts and whatever profit I make half of the proceeds will go to a charities that affiate themselves with sickle cell Disease.</p>
      <p>I want to give back I know how hard it is living with sickle cell Disease;I want to give back,help,and inspire other people who are dealing with sickle cell Disease. </p>
      <p>Today I dont have sickle cell Disease but I now have the Trait.It definetly something I have to get used to but im always up for the challange! </p>
